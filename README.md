# Wikipedia-Covid
As a class project, I decided to work on using Python and the Wikipedia API to examine the activity on Wikipedia over time with respect to Covid-19 and related articles (MERS, SARS, etc.). To that end, I worked in Jupyter Notebook and collected data on pageviews and edits over time. As part of that, I compared across the English, French, and Italian language Wikipedia articles to see if the trends were similar. I then compared the lists of editors by computing Jaccard similiarity for the editors of the English language articles and compared that to the Jaccard similarity for a few random articles. I've got the report text of my work attached which includes my report on my project with the code I used at the bottom of the report. Unfortunately, it's rather too large to view in GitHub.
