# Wikipedia-Covid
As a class project, I decided to work on using Python and the Wikipedia API to examine the activity on Wikipedia over time with respect to Covid-19 and related articles (MERS, SARS, etc.). To that end, I worked in Jupyter Notebook and collected data on pageviews over time. As part of that, I compared across the English, French, and Italian language Wikipedia articles to see if the trends were similar. I then compared the lists of editors by computing Jaccard similiarity for the editors of the English language articles and compared that to the Jaccard similarity for a few random articles. One of the biggest challenges I faced was trying to find all of the article names that existed for a given topic so that I wasn't undercounting the page views while balancing that with avoiding overcounting or double counting articles because of redirect pages (which do count as articles). 
I've got the report text of my work attached which includes [my report](https://github.com/kyleashburn/Wikipedia-Covid/blob/main/Wikipedia%20%26%20Covid%20Report.html) on my project with the code I used at the bottom of the report. Unfortunately, it's rather too large to view in GitHub.
